# PredictiveModelingforAgriculture
**📌 Project Overview**
This project leverages machine learning to help farmers select the most suitable crops based on soil health metrics, such as:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
pH Level
By applying Logistic Regression, the model predicts the best crop for a given soil sample, improving decision-making for farmers.

**🛠️ Technologies Used Python**  
Scikit-Learn  
Pandas  
NumPy

**🚀 Features**
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values and preprocessing.
Feature Analysis – Evaluating individual soil metrics for crop prediction.
Machine Learning Model – Logistic Regression for classification.
Performance Evaluation – Accuracy assessment of different soil features.

**📊 Model Performance**
The model evaluates different soil features individually and selects the most predictive feature for crop recommendation.
